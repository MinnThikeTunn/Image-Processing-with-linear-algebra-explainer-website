# **Image Processing with Linear Algebra Explainer Website**

This is a web-based explainer that demonstrates the fundamental concepts of image processing through the lens of linear algebra. The website provides interactive visualizations to help users understand how operations like matrix transformations are used to manipulate images.

## **Features**

* **Interactive Visualizations**: See the direct effects of linear algebra operations on an image in real-time.  
* **Conceptual Explanations**: Understand how an image is represented as a matrix and how matrix operations correspond to image manipulations like scaling, rotation, and shearing.  
* **User-Friendly Interface**: The application is designed to be straightforward and accessible to anyone with an interest in computer graphics, linear algebra, or image processing.

## **Technologies**

* **HTML, CSS, & JavaScript**: For the core structure, styling, and interactivity of the website.
